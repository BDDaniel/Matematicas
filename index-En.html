				<h3>What is mathematics?</h3>
				<p><br>
					Mathematics is a formal science that, starting from axioms and following logical reasoning, studies properties, abstract structures and relationships between abstract entities such as numbers, geometric figures, icons, glyphs or symbols in general.<br>
					Today, mathematics is used worldwide as an essential tool in many fields, including the natural sciences, applied sciences, humanities, medicine and social sciences, and even seemingly unrelated disciplines such as music (e.g., harmonic resonance). Applied mathematics, a branch of mathematics aimed at the application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of new disciplines. Mathematicians are also involved in pure mathematics, regardless of the application of this science, although the practical applications of pure mathematics are usually discovered over time.<br>
					The word "mathematics" (from the Greek mathēmatiká , "things that are learned") comes from the Ancient Greek (máthēma), meaning "field of study or instruction". Mathematics requires an effort of instruction or apprenticeship, referring to areas of knowledge that can only be understood after having been instructed in it, such as astronomy. "The mathematical art" (mathēmatikḗ tékhnē) would be contrasted in this to music, "the art of the muses" (mousikē téchnē), which would be an art, like poetry, rhetoric, and the like, that can be appreciated directly, "that can be understood without having been instructed." Although the term was already used by the Pythagoreans (matematikoi) in the 6th century B.C., it attained its more technical and reduced meaning of "mathematical study" in the time of Aristotle (4th century B.C.). Its adjective is (mathēmatikós), "relating to learning," which similarly came to mean "mathematical." In particular, (mathēmatikḗ tékhnē; Latin ars mathematica), means "the mathematical art."<br>
					The most commonly used form is the plural mathematics (whose shortening is "mates"), which has the same meaning as the singular and comes from the Latin form mathematica (Cicero), based on the plural in Greek (ta mathēmatiká), used by Aristotle and which means, roughly speaking, "all things mathematical". Some authors, however, make use of the singular form of the term; such is the case of Bourbaki, in the treatise Elements of mathematics (Élements de mathématique, 1940), emphasizes the uniformity of this field brought by the modern axiomatic vision, although he also makes use of the plural form as in Éléments d'histoire des mathématiques (Elements of the history of mathematics) (1969), possibly suggesting that it is Bourbaki who finally realizes the unification of mathematics. Likewise, in L'Architecture des mathématiques (1948) he raises the issue in the section "Mathematics, singular or plural" where he defends the conceptual uniqueness of mathematics although he uses the plural form in that paper.<br><br>
