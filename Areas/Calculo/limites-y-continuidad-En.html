				<h2>addition and subtraction</h2>
				<p>
					<br>The sum, is to gather, join,
                    add, increase, increment, or a defined arithmetic operation
                    over sets of numbers (natural, integer, rational, real, and
                    complex) and subtraction subtraction, is to remove, separate, decrease, compare, etc.,
                    or it is a decomposition operation consisting of given
                    certain amount, remove a part of it, and the result is known as
                    difference, the first number is called the minuend and the second is the
                    subtracting, generating the difference.

				<h1>History</h1>
                <p>
                    <h4>Addition</h4>
                    <br>Addition is one of the oldest and most basic mathematical operations known.
                    It is thought that Neolithic humans already handled elementary mathematical principles,
                    among which would necessarily be addition and subtraction, since these operations are easy to evidence in the face of agricultural provisions that increased and decreased according to the time of year.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Addition Example</h4>
                    <br>Place the addends one below the other, so that the units in the same column coincide.
                    Add each column separately starting with the units.
                    The result of the sum is written below each column and the result line.
                    Let's see an example. Let's add 32 + 64
                    
                    We put the 32 and below it the 64, making the units coincide, that is, the 2 and the 4.
                    
                    We add 2 + 4 = 6 and put it under the ones column.
                    
                    We add 3 + 6 = 9 and put it under the tens column.
                    
                    The result of the addition is 96.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>subtraction</h4>
                    <br>Subtraction or subtraction is an arithmetic operation that is represented by the sign (−); represents the operation of deleting objects from a collection.
                    For example, in the image to the right there are 5 − 2 apples; meaning 5 apples with 2 removed, for a total of 3 apples. Therefore, 5 − 2 = 3.
                    In addition to counting fruits, subtraction can also represent combinations of other physical and abstract quantities using different types of objects: negative numbers, fractions, irrational numbers, vectors, decimals, functions, matrices, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Subtraction Example</h4>
                    <br>Let's see now how you would do a subtraction with carried:
                    <br>-When the digit of the minuend is less than the digit of the subtrahend, you have to ask for help from the digit of the minuend in the next column.
                    <br>-let's subtract 32 – 17
                    <br>-Place the 17 under the 32 so that the units in the same column coincide, that is, the 7 and the 2.
                    <br>-Start by subtracting the ones column: 2 – 7, but since 2 is less than 7 you have to ask the next column for help. This column takes away a ten (3 – 1) to give 10 ones (2 + 10).
                    <br>-Now you can subtract 12 – 7 = 5
                    <br>-Subtract the tens column: 2 – 1 = 1
                    <br>-Therefore, the result of our subtraction with carried is 32 – 17 = 15
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Addition Properties</h4>
                    <br>The properties of the sum are the following:
                    <br><b>Commutative property:</b>The order of the addends (the numbers being added) does not alter the result: a+b=b+a
                    <br><b>Associative property:</b>The result of a sum does not change if some of the addends are replaced by the sum of these.
                    a+b+c=a+(b+c)
                    <br>14+15+10=14+25=39
                    <br><b>Dissociative property:</b>It is the flip side of the associative property. One of the addends can be decomposed and the result is the same.
                    10+13=10+(4+9)=23
                    <br><b>Distributive property:</b>The sum of two or more numbers multiplied by a third number is equal to the sum of each of these addends multiplied by that same third number.
                    (a+b)xc=(axc)+(bxc)
                    <br>(5+6)x4=(5×4)+(6×4)
                    <h4>Subtraction Properties</h4>
                    <br>Subtraction does not have the properties of addition.
                    <br>Subtraction is not an internal operation on the set of natural numbers, because in order for two natural numbers to be subtracted, the minuend number must be greater than the subtrahend number.
                    If that does not happen, that subtraction is not possible in the set of natural numbers because the result would not be a natural number.
                    <br>Subtraction does not have the commutative property, that is, we cannot interchange the position of the minuend with that of the subtrahend.
                    Subtraction also does not have the associative property.
